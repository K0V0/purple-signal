### Download

Binaries are availiable at https://buildbot.hehoe.de/purple-signal/builds/.

### Concept

libpurple plug-ins are written in C.  
The signal client library is written in Java.  
This project uses JNI to create a Java VM instance within the C part of the plug-in. An instance of the Java Class implementing the signal client is created. Upon receival of a message, a static method is called. This call-back method is a native method implemented in C. It forwards the data to libpurple.  
This may be considered dark magic by some.

Please note this is the third purple plugin I have ever written. I still have no idea what I am doing.

### Features

This plug-in is a proof-of-concept with very little features:

* Register a new account
* Link to an existing account  
  Use the provided code text with signal-cli  
  or  
  Scan the provided QR code with with the official app
* Simple Messaging
  * one-to-one conversation
  * Group conversation
  
For more functionality, check out [purple-signald](https://github.com/hoehermann/libpurple-signald). It offers more features, but it depends on a third-party service and thus is Linux only.

### Missing Features

* Attachments
* Proper group chats
* Contact list download
* Group chat management (explicit join, leave, administration, â€¦)
* virtually anything else

### Known Problems

* It takes two minutes for the internal JVM to shut down.
